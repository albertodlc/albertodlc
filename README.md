### Hi there! 👋

I'm `Alberto de la Cruz`, a Telecommunication Engineer from `Bilbao, Spain` who loves new technologies. After a few years working with Salesforce CRM, I decided to change my job and focus on Web Development. 

I'm always open to `new technologies` an `programming languages`, from Classic Desktop Developments to new Android Developments. I would like to take part on interesting Open Source projects and improve my skills as a Software Developer.

- 🔭 I'm currently working at [Baitic](https://www.baitic.com/) as a `Full-Stack Developer`.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning
   - Front-end Frameworks such as `React.js`.
   - Back-end Technologies as `Python` and `Java`.
   - Infraestructure and Architecture with `Dockers`, `Caching Mechanisms` and `Queues`.
   - `Reverse-engineering` techniques and other security related topics.
- 🚀 I’m looking for help with `Open Source projects`.
- 💬 Ask me about new technologies, interesting Frameworks and projects.
